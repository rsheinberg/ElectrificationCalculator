The original logic to run the calculator was developed in Python for ease of use. It was then transitioned to R to be able to take
advantage of Posit's "Shiny" application, which is only in beta form for Python. 

Thus, this folder contains the original calculator logic, including "Scaling Factors," which was used to develop the multipliers
used between upgrade scenarios.
