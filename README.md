# LADWP Building Electrification Calculator

This repository contains the initial functions to run an interactive building electrification calculator. The calculator will be used to estimate the impact of appliance and vehicle electrification on household energy bills in Los Angeles. The foundation of the calculator is NREL's End-Use Load Profiles for U.S. Building Stock dataset.
