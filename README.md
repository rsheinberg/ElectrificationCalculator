# LADWP Building Electrification Calculator

A draft of the calculator webpage, including personal vehicle electrification options, can be found here: https://rsheinb.shinyapps.io/ladwp_bill_calc/

This repository contains the initial functions to run the interactive building electrification calculator linked above. The calculator can be used to estimate the impact of appliance and vehicle electrification on household energy bills in Los Angeles. The foundation of the calculator is NREL's End-Use Load Profiles for U.S. Building Stock dataset: https://www.nrel.gov/buildings/end-use-load-profiles.html

The calculator also utilizes LADWP's recent residential electricity rates: https://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/wcnav_externalId/a-fr-elecrate-schel?_adf.ctrl-state=d1msyrnyd_4&_afrLoop=837791826597258&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=hkdwrxi4u_1#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dhkdwrxi4u_1%26_afrLoop%3D837791826597258%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dhkdwrxi4u_17 . 

and SoCal Gas's residential natural gas tariffs: https://tariff.socalgas.com/regulatory/tariffs/tm2/pdf/tariffs/GAS_G-SCHEDS_GR.pdf .
